# 2020-09-10 IMM 360 Plan
## Recapping the Survey Feedback
- Almost everyone wanted to give Zoom a try, so here we go with the Zoom link!
- As expected, there’s a range of comfort level with Unity so far
## Assignment Due Dates/Times Plan
- Projects: Wednesday midnight, with grace period through Thursday
- Challenges and Screenshot Saturdays: Tuesdays at noon with grace period through end of the day
## Following Up on Previous Challenges
### Ponglike - Josh
- How to do the stretch challenge for *Ponglike* - score variable and update
### Breakoutlike - Ellie?
- How to do the score with a static variable
- How to do the stretch challenge - `for` loops to Instantiate a grid

## How to Take Notes so You Don’t Have to Memorize
- Use browser bookmarks with notes
- Use Google Docs with Outline feature and your own observations
- Use something like [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) to keep your notes
- Make an index page for your personal, physical notebook

## Today’s Challenge - Marble Madness-like
### First, Let’s Look at Marble Madness!
- Screen share with NES Emulated version of the game for just a couple minutes and ask, what do you observe (write down your observations in the Zoom chat—we’ll switch to Discord during our open time)
- That control scheme - there’s really no good one way to do it. So let’s plan to allow the player in our demo to choose between the two control schemes also!
### Overview of Today’s Demo and Challenge
#### Demo
- The other things we’re going to implement, time permitting:
	- [ ] Creating a basic course for our sphere to move around in
	- [ ] Aside: talk about why the sphere rotates when we add a force (add a slippery physics material to show what happens, making sure the sphere has texture so we can see it rotate)
	- [ ] Moving and rotating the camera to create a typical “third-person” view
	- [ ] Rotating and changing camera projection to create an isometric view
	- [ ] Adjusting our player controller to accommodate for the isometric view
	- [ ] Add ability to switch control modes and a method for showing the player which control mode they are currently using
	- [ ] Create a basic checkpoint system using triggers and prefabs, `Find` (in their `Start` method to get reference to the player)
	- [ ] Create a “win” trigger at the end of the course
	- [ ] Tweaking and refining movement by exposing values in the inspector
	- [ ] Introduce Probuilder, ProGrid (download via package manager) and discuss the concept of greyboxing
	- [ ] Add a couple ramps - make a sandbox for testing out movement (put some walls so we don't fall off, or maybe have some places where we do fall off)
	- [ ] Creating [a second camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MultipleCameras.html) so that we can switch between the two views of the game
	- [ ] Creating a camera follow script so that our course can extend beyond the current camera view (using initial “sync” and offset setting in `Start`, followed by movement based on that offset in `LateUpdate`).
#### Challenge
* And the challenge that you’ll have this week:
	- [ ] Use ProBuilder to create an interesting course using geometry
	- [ ] Implement checkpoints throughout the course so that players can return to a previous point
	- [ ] Ensure that the game can be played more than once (i.e. implement a “game loop”, using `Debug.Log` to print the game state (“you won”) to the console, and allow for restarting the game)
	- [ ] *Stretch Challenge*: Add a surface texture and physics material to create something slippery, sticky, slimy, etc. to add challenge to the course

### Now, Let’s Get Into Unity
