## Design Corner: Proteus

## Following Up on Project 1


## Overview of Today’s Demo and Challenge
### Demo

1. [ ] First person controller - why you may (or may not) want to write your own
2. [ ] Terrain Editor Basics
	3. [ ] Download Terrain Tools package and corresponding assets. (Steps are a little weird - you need to go through 
3. [ ] Trees and generally a cool environment
4. [ ] Sound! Spacial audio! Sounds combining to make even nicer sounds
5. [ ] Adding interactions with the mouse in first-person (Raycast)Change how the cursor looks

### Challenge
* And the challenge that you’ll have this week:
	- [ ] Use ProBuilder to create an interesting course using geometry
	- [ ] Implement checkpoints throughout the course so that players can return to a previous point
	- [ ] Ensure that the game can be played more than once (i.e. implement a “game loop”, using `Debug.Log` to print the game state (“you won”) to the console, and allow for restarting the game)
	- [ ] *Stretch Challenge*: Add a surface texture and physics material to create something slippery, sticky, slimy, etc. to add challenge to the course
